The paper opens with an introduction on persistent homology, then introduces an approach to study the structure of deep nets using topological data analysis (TDA) tools. Three case studies are then presented, for which a measure of change in topological structure of the network during training is compared with the validation set error. The argument of the paper is that the two measures are correlated, and therefore it may be possible to use the topological measure (which depends on the structure of the network only, and not on data) in place of the validation set error to assess the generalization performance of a deep net.","This paper proposes a topological data analysis approach to investigate the inner workings of a deep network.

1,SP:190e69f0d6538fa7e87d77df6cdf93c7a1d83f90,"This paper address the problem of neural network single-shot structured-based model pruning.   Deep convolutional neural networks grow to achieve higher performance, which also means slower inference and higher computational cost. Model pruning can help with that. Model pruning can be unstructured, which means to remove individual weights, or structured, which means to remove entire substructures, e.g., nodes or channels. This paper focuses on structured pruning.  A key challenge for global saliency-based structured model pruning is to find a good objective that can be efficiently calculated to make the approach scalable to various modern convolutional neural networks. Existing saliency-based pruning methods such as OBD, C-OBD evaluate the effect of removing a single weight or structure on the loss of the neural network in isolation. This work is to devise a 2nd order pruning method that considers all global correlations for structured sensitivity pruning.  The basic idea in this work is to search for the pruning mask M to minimize the joint effect on the network loss approximately. The mathematical approximation focuses on the second-order approximation to the loss.   The key contributions of this work are the proposed 2nd-order structured pruning (SOSP). There are two variants of that. The first one is based on fast hessian-vector products, and it has the same complexity as that with first-order methods. A second one is based on the Gaussian-newton approximation. The first one with fast hessian-vector products do better in terms of scale.  Experiments on VGG, ResNets, PlainNet, DenseNet are shown promising results across various image classification datasets, including Cifar10/100 and ImageNet. ","This paper presents two novel approximation techniques for approximating the importance of a filter (the estimated loss difference between pruned and pre-trained networks) using second order approximations. The main difficulties of second order approximation lie in the computational burden of computing the full Hessian matrix. To circumvent this issue, this paper presents two novel ways to do so. The first approach, dubbed SOSP-I, linearize the neural network and only consider the coupling of the loss function. The second approach, dubbed SOSP-H, approximate the loss difference using a Hessian-vector product. Both approaches have much better efficiency compared to using the Hessian and empirically perform a little better than existing approaches. Overall, the approximations seem novel to me and I find the appendix helpful in understanding the derivations. However, their empirical advantages seem rather limited. Additionally, I think some of the related papers are missed and they need to be discussed and compared against.","This work proposes a structured pruning method that removes feature maps (channels) of convolutional neural networks without losing accuracy while increasing computational efficiency (MACs). The proposed method (SOSP-I/H) is based on a sensitivity based saliency and involves what they call global correlations through the second order partial derivatives with respect to different structures. SOSP shares a lot in common with previous works including OBD and C-OBD for the use of second order information except that they approximately incorporate all elements in the Hessian matrix. Then the paper evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed method for image classification task using VGG, ResNet, and Desnet on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and achieve accuracies on par with previous works on both global and local (layerwise) pruning. The paper further presents that SOSP works on pruning at initialization and can improve further by performing expand-pruning based on skewed distribution of retained parameters over layers. ",This paper proposed a structured pruning method which include correlations among structures by second order information. The author also improved the computational efficiency by fast Hessian-vector products. The method is demonstrated to achieve comparable/better results than previous methods. And it can also be applied to pruning-at-initialization and reveal architecture bottlenecks.,"This paper presents saliency-based second-order structured pruning methods, namely SOSP-I and SOSP-H. The proposed methods are designed to capture the correlations among all structures and layers, known as second-order structure (Hessian). In particular, SOSP-I employs Hessian approximation while SOSP-H employs exact Hessian. Overall, the idea of this paper is very clear, and I kinda like the discussion part of it. The expand-pruning is also interesting. ","This paper proposes a method to prune deep neural networks.

(2), and the authors consider maximizing the lower bound of Eq. (2) in Corollary 1 as a surrogate learning objective. The aforementioned neural density model is used to estimate the expert state-action visitation distribution (or occupancy measure) which works as a component of a reward function (the log of the neural density model) during the RL phase, together with the entropy regularization ($r_\pi$) and a critic-based reward ($r_f$). While Adversarial Imitation Learning requires the alternate optimization for policy and reward estimators, the proposed idea does not require the reward learning phase (similar to RED, Disagreement regularized IL and SQIL), which may stabilize the learning procedure. While the proposed idea is straightforward to be understood, the empirical results show that NDI outperforms its baselines especially when the number of expert demonstrations is small. The ablation studies on learned density and varying MI reward weight are also interesting to follow. ","The paper proposes an non-adversarial imitation learning algorithm based on density estimation of expert demonstrations. The proposed method derives a lower bound on the reverse KL divergence ($KL(\pi | \pi_{E})$), which is translated into a composite reward function consisting of 3 addictive terms. Empirical results show improved performance in Mujoco benchmarks. ","This work proposes a novel density matching method for learning from demonstration, which achieves state-of-the-art demonstration efficiency. Prior density matching methods utilize the adversarial methods suffers from the instability of optimization. To overcome this issue, this work proposes to separate the imitation process into expert density estimation phase and density matching phase, where a model-free formulation is derived and provably served as the lower bound of reverse KL divergence between $\pi_\theta$ and expert policy $\pi_E$.","This paper introduces an approach for imitation learning based on density estimation. The approach uses the previously introduced idea of minimizing some divergence between policy and expert occupancy measures, state-action distributions induced by these policies. The authors propose to first estimate expert occupancy measure either using an autoregressive density model or an energy based model. Then authors use the Donsker-Varadhan KL representation to compute a log ratio between $p(s_{t+1}|s_t)$ and $p(s_t)$ where $s_{t}$ is a state at time $t$. Then, the expert occupancy and the KL representation are used as RL reward for imitation learning. ","The authors propose a new imitation learning algorithm that attempts to (indirectly) minimize the KL between the imitation learner distribution and the expert distribution. The main novelty consists in the fact that the objective includes the entropy over the state-action space (as opposed to the average entropy of the action distributions given the state). In order to deal with this entropy term, the authors use a learned approximation to the state-action occupancy distribution.","This paper presents an imitation learning approach based on density estimation of the state-action pairs. The underlying idea is to take expert demonstrations and find a distribution over the inherent state occupancy and then follow-up with a reinforcement learning step. As a result, the learner visits the high density state action pairs while also exploring new states during training. The paper makes a number of interesting contributions, among a new cost function for distribution matching IL and a proof showing that it is equivalent to maximizing a non-adversarial model-free RL objective. In contrast to other methods, like AIL, no adversarial optimization is needed; which typically would have resulted in instabilities. Instead the new objective pushes the lower bound in a single direction. The paper also features a list of tradeoffs between different distribution matching IL methods.

The authors first represent the state of the system with a set of intuitive classifiers, and then explain why a counterfactual (termed foil), would fail or cost more than the agent’s policy based on this classifier representation. For example, identifying that “move left” leads to a failure state in a game when the current state has the classifier “platform_edge_on_left” = True, as one its descriptors. Similar ideas extend to identifying an overly costly foil policy. The authors develop how such state characterization can be constructed, how feasibility of actions can be learned from sampling, and how a simple Bayesian formalism can be used to quantify uncertainty arising from sampling and other assumptions. They go on to show how the proposed idea works for two game settings, as well as how these explanations are preferred by human subjects over saliency based ones.",The paper presents a search procedure with concept classifiers to generate symbolic explanations (in terms of preconditions and costs) to justify an agent's action w.r.t. a foil agent. The authors conducted user study to show the usefulness of their method.,"(NB: I reviewed a previous version of this paper. I was in favour of its acceptance. In my opinion, this version is far more clear and addresses the most salient concerns of the reviewers, including me. I'll keep this review self-contained and refer to this submission).  The paper proposes a methodology for providing post-hoc explanations in sequential decision settings without assuming a model of the environment. Usual methods for explainability do not translate well into sequential decision settings, as the explanation is related to the executed actions. In particular, what's the natural form for such explanations? A simple but useful query is to ask about modifications to the plan retuned by the AI agent. These are called constrastive explanations. Those modifications could be a) better, b) lead use some illegal action execution, c) be more expensive.  The method creates a symbolic approximation around the current situation. The approximation allows to show the user a single concept that is missing and makes an action fail, or to increase the cost. The validation with users reports that they are finding them usefull. A more indirect test, less sensitive to the bias of self-report, is whether they can solve a task faster. Those results are also positive.  ","This paper presents a novel approach to generate contrastive explanations in a dialogue setting between a human and a planning agent. The setting assumes that the agent generates and offers an optimal plan to the user, and the user in turn challenges the presented plan offering an alternative (i.e. a contrast/foil). The goal of the agent is the denounce the alternative plan by explaining the infeasibility or suboptimality of the plan to the user in concepts they understand.","The authors propose a method of explainable AI for inscrutable blackbox models. The explanations build on a set of user-defined primitives, independently trained on the blackbox representation (e.g., visual frames of an Atari game), and use an increasingly popular method of providing contrastive explanations. Two forms of foil-based responses are provided: (1) indication of action failure from the planning perspective (preconditions unsatisfied); and (2) an explanation of relative sub-optimality that highlights key aspects of action costs that the user may be unaware of.","This paper proposes a symbolic model implemented alongside a planning AI, which can respond to human  queries about why one plan is taken by the AI, and not another.  The system takes as input a user concept vocabulary, where each concept is implemented by binary classifier indicating whether the proposition is present. This concept vocabulary needs to be initially solicited from the user -- either through user surveys or designed by researchers.  The output of the classifiers is noisy, which is interpreted as confidence over the proposed explanation. The system then uses a symbolic PPDL model with the concept vocabulary to answer queries. The system can issue two types of answers about why a proposed plan is inadmissible: (1) a pre-condition for a given action is missing or (2) the proposed plan is more costly than the chosen plan.  To identify if a concept is a precondition for action A, the system samples a number of states from the model where A is executable. If concept is always present, then it is a pre-condition. Samples are generated by a random walk from one of the states in the model's given plan. In the evaluated problems games the sampling algorithm needs ~500 samples to accurately identify the missing pre-condition.

Previous work shows that normalization methods and the spectral properties of monolingual word embeddings have a big impact on alignment methods. Building on these results, the paper proposes a normalization method that regularizes the spectral properties of monolingual word embeddings. The method is then combined with mean centering and length normalization in an iterative process. Empirically, the proposed normalization method improves alignment and leads to better CLWE (measured by scores on bilingual lexicon induction, cross-lingual document classification, and natural language inference).","The paper proposes a new normalization method for monolingual word embeddings before aligning them between different languages. The normalization is based on spectral properties of the monolingual embeddings and aims to level the contributions of those leading singular values while maintaining those smaller ones at the same time. Further inspired by previous works that centers and units the length of monolingual embeddings, the authors propose an iterative normalization that combines the spectral normalization with centering and unit length normalization. The proposed method achieves better performance in both bilingual lexical induction (BLI) tasks as well as downstream tasks like cross-lingual document classification (CLDC) and cross-lingual natural language inference (XNLI). ","This paper describes three new methods for normalizing word embeddings before cross-lingual alignment. The first method, SpecNorm, caps the singular values of the word embeddings to be twice the average (original) singular values. The second method does mean centering, SpecNorm, and L2 normalization. The third repeats this for a fixed number of iterations (5). Experiments on a wide variety of tasks generally show improvements. ","This paper presents a new approach to normalizing (static) word embeddings prior to learning the mapping between them to induce an improved shared cross-lingual word embedding (CLWE) space. The main idea is to improve shared cross-lingual spaces not via learning more sophisticated mapping functions or by designing a new CLWE learning paradigm, but rather to affect the properties of independently trained monolingual embeddings to increase their alignability. In other words, normalization can be seen as a pre-processing step that is orthogonal to the actual mapping/projection functions, and improving normalization can have a positive impact on the final shared space. The core contribution of the paper is therefore the spectral normalization method, built on top of the recent advances and insights from prior work, which yields gains over other normalization techniques from prior work in the intrinsic task of Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) and several transfer tasks (which rely on the CLWEs).","The paper proposes an Iterative Spectral Normalization method to improve pairwise Cross-Lingual Word Embedding alignment.

To simulate a physical system, PBD first computes updated locations of vertices then corrects the estimates of the initial position by constraint projection.  The projection step is computationally expensive, and that is where the proposed COPINGNet is applied to generate a good initial guess for the built-in linear system solver (e.g., CG).","This paper presents a learning-based technique to speed up the physics simulation of rod structures using PBD. The key motivation is to notice that solving the nonlinear system using CG is the key bottleneck in the physics simulation. To speed up the CG solver, this paper proposes to train a neural network that predicts a good initial guess for CG in the hope that it will reduce the number of iterations before convergence. This paper presents experiments with tens to over a thousand nodes and shows that the speedup technique reduces the number of iterations used in CG by a factor of at most 2.5 (Fig. 6).","This paper aims to accelerate the iterative physical simulators using graph neural networks, by combining the traditional iterative rod solver and the graph networks. Instead of an end-to-end way, this paper uses the trained GNN to provide the initial guess of the iterative solver to reduce the number of iterations. In the experiments section, this paper shows the improved run time performance compared with the traditional solver and a KKN method. ","This paper proposes to train a graph network to estimate the initial guess of a conjugate gradient solver in a rod dynamics simulation pipeline. By using a better initial position given by the graph network, the CG solver can converge faster than optimizing from zero vectors. The authors show how to construct such a network and demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of their hybrid method in various simulation settings.","The authors consider the problem of speeding up a specific form of dynamic simulation - position based dynamics, used as a solver to simulate the dynamic evolution of rods. I believe this is a timely topic, both due to the growing importance of simulations in various communities within AI, and because flexible objects are becoming more relevant in some of these applications.  The core concern of this paper is to find ways to speed up PBD solvers. To the extent that the iterative process of constraint projection is computationally expensive, there is scope for finding surrogates that could perform something like this computation quicker. The author's proposal is to use a Graph Neural Network to act as a surrogate for the analytical calculation. In contract to some other works that aim at replacing the entire simulator, the authors restrict the scope here to only using the neural network to emulating the specific projection step, which then serves as an initialisation, speeding up subsequent computation. This is a good idea and the empirical data supports its use. The empirical experiments in this paper are simulations of free evolution of a rod and a spring, clamped on one side, after an initial perturbation.

This scheme generates the action distribution parameters for each state at the end of an inner loop which takes the objective gradient wrt to the parameters also as input (as opposed to a regular actor network which does one forward pass). This seems similar to prior work on learning to learn/meta learning but the presentation can be improved (more detailed comments below).  Experimental evidence is given for benefits over SAC in mujoco environments.","This paper introduces a novel approach to policy optimization which leverages the connection between amortized variational inference and policy-based RL with function approximation. Specifically, rather than rely on a ""direct"" parameterization of the state-conditioned distribution over actions, in which an input state is mapped directly to distribution parameters (e.g., mean and variance), the approach adds an additional optimization procedure over the distribution parameters themselves, rather than those of the policy network. Experimental results are then used to demonstrate the benefits of this approach for performance, accuracy, and flexibility in the optimization process. ","The authors, via a standard reinterpretation of reinforcement learning as an inference problem, discusses the resulting “amortization gap” that results from using policy networks to optimize the variational lower bound. In order to close this gap, the authors propose to train an iterative procedure parameterized by $\phi$, which uses estimated gradients of the return to iteratively refine $\pi(\cdot | s_t)$ for the current state $s_t$. They then provide an extensive experimental evaluation demonstrating their proposed method and several desirable properties, including adaptability to gradients estimated by different methods.","This paper draws an interesting connection to variational inference, categorizing current policy optimization methods with KL regularization as direct amortized optimizers. The paper shows how direct amortized policy optimization can be suboptimal and proposes a new class of method called iterative amortized policy optimization. This ‘iterative’ amortized policy optimization performs iterative optimization before the regular optimization step, offering several advantages: better at reaching the optima, better at sampling multiple modes, and support more rapidly changing policy. The paper shows nice visualization to support these claims and also run benchmark experiments to show its improvement.","This work analyzes policy optimization from an inference perspective. It first shows that policy optimization with entropy or KL regularization in DRL with a policy network is a form of amortized optimization where instead of directly optimizing the action distribution parameters, we optimize a network which outputs the action distribution parameters. This results in an amortization gap which negatively impacts performance and exploration. Next the authors propose an alternative iterative amortization method for training the policy network. This new approach is shown to have various benefits which the authors demonstrated through a series of experiments on the MuJoCo environments.","**Contributions**: The authors propose to use iterative amortization for policy optimization to help reduce suboptimality in policy optimization. They find that like in variational inference for generative modeling, iterative amortization is able cover multiple modes of distributions and lower the amortization gap, and show slightly improved performance on mujoco gym benchmarks. Additionally, they find that the iteratively amortized policy is able to better exploit the learned Q function and lead to more overestimation bias, and address this by tuning a parameter to make the Q-function backups more pessimistic to compensate.",0.3592233009708738,0.2524271844660194,0.2621359223300971,0.36893203883495146,0.2815533980582524,0.28421052631578947,0.29473684210526313,0.45263157894736844,0.30526315789473685,0.23333333333333334,0.34444444444444444,0.32222222222222224,0.2978723404255319,0.2978723404255319,0.32323232323232326,0.3894736842105263,0.28888888888888886,0.2872340425531915,0.3838383838383838,0.31868131868131866,0.3,0.2978723404255319,0.43434343434343436,0.31868131868131866,0.22340425531914893,0.31313131313131315,0.31868131868131866,0.2828282828282828,0.3076923076923077,0.3516483516483517,0.3737373737373738,0.26943005181347146,0.2741116751269036,0.37623762376237624,0.29896907216494845,0.29189189189189185,0.2962962962962962,0.443298969072165,0.31182795698924726,0.22826086956521738,0.3280423280423281,0.32044198895027626,0.29015544041450775,0.30270270270270266,0.3368421052631579

Some recent works (laskin et al, kostrikov et al) have shown data-augmentation to be an effective technique in curbing the overfitting issue. However, different games have different biases and hence require different data augmentation. This paper proposes to use UCB algorithm to automatically select a good data augmentation (from a list of data augmentations) for a game. However, naively applying data augmentation to RL algorithms like PPO isn’t theoretically sound. To address this problem, the paper introduces novel policy and value regularization. Overall, the paper contains extensive experiments and ablation studies.","The paper proposes a framework for automatic data augmentation in deep RL. It proposes three algorithms based on 1) UCB 2) RL2 3) meta-learning, combining PPO and regularization of both the actor and critic to make sure that the policy and value function are invariant to the transformation corresponding to the augmentation. Experiments on ProcGen and the DMC with distractors show that the UCB-based algorithm (UCB-DrAC) outperforms vanilla deep RL and previous data augmentation baselines and is competitive with the best augmentation type chosen post hoc.","This paper presents a method for improving generalization in reinforcement learning using data augmentation. It identifies a key theoretical limitation of previous work in the naive application of data augmentation to actor critic methods and proposes a solution that avoids biased estimation of the policy gradient objective while still allowing for regularization of the policy and value function. The resulting loss is paired with three distinct approaches for identifying an optimal data augmentation strategy. The best of these approaches, a bandit algorithm, obtains SOTA performance (relative to published works) on the Procgen environment.

In specific, they measure the downstream performance using the approximation error and estimation error, and establish their initial results under a strict condition -- conditional independence (CI) and linear function space in Section 3, then extend it to ACI and arbitrary function space in Section 4, resulting in the main contribution Theorem 4.2 that clearly quantifies the generalization error. The theorem is also verified in Section 5 using simulations on NLP tasks. ","This paper attempts to understand why self-supervised learning works in the following sense: will the sample complexity for a downstream task be decreased (compared to the standard supervised learning without pretraining) if it is pre-trained according to some related auxiliary task? The relation between tasks is formulated as the approximate conditional independence of the dependent variables. The main theoretical results show that the sample complexity (compared to supervised learning) can be decreased under Assumption 3.5, 4.1, and 4.2.

In such a setting, it is shown that the optimal pretext function has certain good properties: it linearly separates the supervised task, and is ""low rank"", so can be used for efficient downstream learning.","This paper studies whether reconstruction-based pretext task can provide representations helpful for downstream tasks, which is a question of good interests in the community.  The authors give an affirmative answer that when (approximate) conditional independence holds, reconstruction as a pretext task provides representations such that 1) an additional linear layer is sufficient to ensure small approximation error on classification, and that 2) helps to reduce the sample complexity of the classification task from complexity of the function class (without pretraining) to linear in data dimension.

They begin with a conditional independent setting, where X1 is conditionally independent of X2 given Y. - The high-level idea is to first pre-train a model that predicts X2 from X1. This can be done on unlabeled data. Then they can fit a model on top of representations learned by this model, to predict Y. 1. Ground truth self-supervision: They show that if we learn E[X2 | X1], the ground truth self-supervision function, then under mild invertibility conditions, E[Y | X] is a linear function of E[X2 | X1]. Further, E[X2 | X1]'s effective dimension is the same as Y, so this linear function can be fit using very few examples. In contrast, the function from X1 or X2 to Y can be very complicated / non-linear and require many examples to fit. 2. Linear self-supervision: They then examine what happens if we fit a linear function (on feature space) to predict X2 from X1. This can learn a useful lower dimensional embedding, and then we train a linear classifier to predict Y on top of this. They show this is more sample efficient than just training a linear classifier from X1 to Y. 3. Relaxing conditional independence: They quantitatively examine how this degrades when we don't exactly have conditional independence. Their bounds will still be good if things are ""almost"" conditionally independent.

The authors present PeerPL, a unified framework that can train agents using behavior cloning under noisy/suboptimal demonstrations, or using reinforcement learning under noisy rewards. PeerPL uses the idea of “Correlated Agreement” by subtracting the original objective with a second term. The second term evaluates on randomly paired state-action tuples and supervisions, punishing the “blind” agreement between the learning agent and the weak supervision. The authors instantiate this idea on both behavior cloning and RL (PG/DQN), and also evaluate it on the problem of policy co-training. The authors demonstrate that PeerPL outperforms the weak supervision baselines on IL and RL setting, and sometimes it even outperforms agents trained with clean supervision.

Two categories of noisy feedback are considered, noisy reward in reinforcement learning and noisy demonstrations in behavioral cloning. The concept of “correlated agreement” (CA) is proposed as a regularization mechanism for a policy to learn from the noisy feedback without overfitting to it. An additional policy co-training setting is also considered. Empirical evaluations control games and Atari show that CA is effective in enabling policy learning from noisy feedback.",This paper proposes a method for RL and imitation learning in the setting where the reward function or expert actions are corrupted with noise. The main idea is to regularize the learned policy to have *high* loss on unaligned state-action-reward examples. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms baselines that either learn directly using the noisy rewards/actions or learn an auxiliary function that predicts the mean reward/action. ,"This paper proposed a framework to improve the efficacy of sensorimotor control learning. The main idea consists of augmenting the training loss with a specifically designed term that avoids the policy to ""overfit"" to noise present in the reward (for RL) or in the demonstrations (for behavioral cloning).  This extra term aims to minimize the probability that when randomly associating rewards and state-action pairs, the policy performs poorly. This idea, borrowed by the theory of correlated agreement, should improve the policy performance when the supervision (in terms of demonstration or reward) is corrupted by noise. Experiments show that the proposed framework achieves comparable or better results than prior works.","The authors propose a general and unified framework to study policy learning without strong or high-quality supervision signals. This unified framework comprises, but not limited to, the main approaches for policy learning, including those using rewards signals in reinforcement learning (RL) and demonstrations through behavioral cloning (BC). The authors also propose PeerPL, a solution for efficient policy learning using only weak supervision signals, which evaluates an agent’s learning policy with noisy signals, treated as policy of an imperfect “peer agent”. The weak supervision signal comes in the form of correlation with the imperfect peer agent’s report, while the solution encourages generalization through penalizing identical reports.",0.453125,0.296875,0.28125,0.375,0.375,0.2619047619047619,0.2222222222222222,0.36507936507936506,0.3412698412698413,0.2727272727272727,0.3977272727272727,0.4090909090909091,0.5352112676056338,0.352112676056338,0.3090909090909091,0.4603174603174603,0.4318181818181818,0.5070422535211268,0.43636363636363634,0.4444444444444444,0.375,0.39436619718309857,0.41818181818181815,0.39814814814814814,0.3380281690140845,0.3181818181818182,0.3333333333333333,0.34545454545454546,0.23148148148148148,0.3148148148148148,0.4566929133858268,0.35185185185185186,0.36180904522613067,0.40336134453781514,0.4067796610169491,0.30841121495327106,0.2842639593908629,0.38983050847457623,0.3675213675213675,0.3018867924528302,0.35353535353535354,0.36734693877551017,0.419889502762431,0.27932960893854747,0.3119266055045872
