The paper proposes Indirect Imitation Learning (I2L), which aims to perform imitation learning with respect to a trajectory buffer that contains some of the previous trajectories of the agent. The trajectory buffer has limited capacity and adds trajectories based on a priority-queue that prefers trajectories that have a similar state distribution to the expert. Similarity is hereby measured by the score of a WGAN-critic trained to approximate the W1-Wasserstein distance between the previous buffer and the expert distribution. By performing imitation learning with respect to a trajectory buffer, state-action trajectories of the agent's MDP are available, which enables I2L to apply AIRL (Fu et al. 2017). By using those trajectories for the transition buffer that have state-marginals close to the expert's trajectory, I2L produces similar behavior compared to the expert. I2L is compared to state-only GAIL, state-action-GAIL and AIRL on four MuJoCo tasks with modified dynamics compared to the expert policy. The experiments show that I2L may learn significantly better policies if the dynamics of agent and the expert do not match.","The paper proposes an imitation method, I2L, that learns from state-only demonstrations generated in an expert MDP that may have different transition dynamics than the agent MDP.

This approach maximizes a lower bound on the likelihood of the demonstrations. Experiments comparing I2L to a state-only GAIL baseline show that I2L performs significantly better under dynamics mismatch in several low-dimensional, continuous MuJoCo tasks.",0.15121951219512195,0.29523809523809524,0.2

The paper starts by proposing a methodology for generating a controlled dataset of binary masks consisting of random polygons. All training and testing is conducted on this dataset. After showing that convolutions and high data diversity enable better generalization across these transformations, the paper proposes two additional ways to improve performance. Firstly, their approach transforms input images into log-polar space, as object rotations in the original space is equivalent to translations in this space, and thus convolutions on log-polar space are equivariant to rotations in the original pixel space. Secondly, the paper proposes an iterative approach to model transformations, where output mask generated by their Encoder-Decoder model is fed back into the network as an input. The motivation behind this iterative approach is that these transformations form a symmetric group, and so the output after k iterations is still a member of the set which can be reached via a single transformation. The motivation is that such training would force the network to preserve the shape being transformed across iterations.

When $T$ and $Y$ possess entries that are i.i.d Gaussians with mean 0 and variance $\Delta_p$ and $\Delta_2$ respectively, we have the mixed $p$-spin model. When $T$ and $Y$ are given by a Gaussian perturbation of vector $x^*$ on the $\sqrt{N}$ radius $N$-dimensional sphere, we have the spiked matrix-tensor model. Finding the ground state for mixed $p$-spin, and recovering the planted signal from the spiked tensor model then correspond to finding $x$ which minimizes loss $\mathcal{L}$. Note in the latter case that $x$ which minimizes loss will also have a large overlap with $x^*$ hence why one considers this problem as recovering a planted signal.  This work uses the cavity method to derive mean dynamics for iterates produced by accelerated gradient methods. They construct a sequence of equations that track correlation between iterates maintained by Nesterov‚Äôs acceleration and Polyak‚Äôs Heavy Ball Momentum. These equations are parameterized by different time steps of the algorithm; for example, the equation for $C_x[t, t‚Äô]$ corresponds to the overlap of $x$ at time $t$ with that at time $t‚Äô$.  The dynamic mean field equations can be used to heuristically determine computational thresholds for statistical signal recovery in the following sense. For an instance of finding a planted signal from a spiked matrix-tensor model given by samples of $T$ and $Y$, consider the instance‚Äôs signal-to-noise ratio $\frac{\Delta_p}{\Delta_2}$. For a fixed value of $\Delta_p$ and as one increases $\Delta_2$, it becomes increasingly difficult to recover the planted spike $x^*$. At a certain value of $\Delta_2$, say $\delta^*$, an iterative method solving the instance may exhibit a phase transition: for $\Delta_2 < \delta^*$ the method will find $x$ that has large overlap with $x^*$, while for $\Delta_2 > \delta^*$, the method only converges to $x$ that has vanishingly small (w.r.t. $N$) overlap with $x^*$.   The authors use the mean dynamic equations to compute statistical recovery thresholds for Nesterov acceleration and Heavy Ball momentum. The cavity method calculations are heuristic, and so the authors support their estimates with experiments that suggest the true threshold for these two methods are very close to their estimates.

","**Summary and Contributions**:  The paper introduces a framework called Frame Averaging (FA) that can adapt existing backbone architectures to become invariant/equivariant to new symmetry types. It achieves this by averaging over an input-dependent frame which outputs a subset of groups. Frame averaging is often much more efficient to compute than averaging over the entire group, while at the same time, guarantees exact invariance/equivariance.  On the technical side, the paper also proves that FA-based models have the same expressive power as the original backbone architectures.  On the empirical side, the paper provides new classes of models using FA such as universal Euclidean motion invariant point cloud networks / Message Passing GNNs, and demonstrates their practical effectiveness on several tasks.

By allowing the prediction error of some segments to go above $\epsilon$, the number of segments can be decreased, allowing for better trade-offs in some cases.

A data-driven approach is proposed to solve the problem. While the topological map of the environment is required, no prior information is needed about the nature of the input signal. Moreover, no supervision (in terms of pairs of signal measurement and observer's location) is needed.  The work formulates the localization problem as the problem of learning a low-dimensional manifold, representing the input in their intrinsic space and then transport them to the given topological map by inferring correspondences between the two spaces. The work is built on two intuitions: 1. that the transformation from high-dimensional input to the intrinsic space can be modeled as a mapping that can be learned through a neural network; 2. temporal data is subject to gradual changes as the observer moves, suggesting that the data reside on a smooth, locally connected manifold;  Results from experiments on three different environments (and different sensory inputs) support the claims. ","This paper presents a new method for localization while being agnostic to input measurement signal's modality. Assuming a map is given, localization inside the map is formulated as a deep manifold learning problem, without needing the supervision of ground truth positions for each input measurement.

The B-VAE is trained unsupervised and learns an encoder and decoder which provide both an embedding and a reconstruction. Using t-SNE to reduce its dimensionality, the embedding is projected into a 2 dimensional space. An anomaly score function is defined that combines the reconstruction error and the distance in t-SNE space to the K nearest neighbor(s). Experiments are conducted with several image datasets (MNIST,FMNIST,CIFAR10,SmallNORB) and one timeseries dataset (Arrhythmia). For the image sets, the B-VAE model is implemented with a CNN, while for timeseries, a TCN is used. Comparisons are conducted showing the approach to be beat other SOT unsupervised methods, AnoGAN and ADGAN, by 63% and 22% respectively for MNIST and 8% and 2% for FMNIST (in terms of error reduction). For CIFAR-10 and FMNIST it is even demonstrated to beat a supervised SOT method CapsNET. Another experiment shows that t_SNE dramatically improves the performance over B-VAE alone.

One way to do this is to learn a model of the underlying distribution, and test whether the additional data fall within the typical set of the model. This paper points out that the typical set of the model may be very different from the typical set of the underlying distribution if the model is learned by maximum likelihood, in which case a test of typicality with respect to the model would be a poor test of typicality with respect to the underlying distribution. The paper shows theoretically that the intersection of the typical sets of an ensemble of models lies within the typical set of the underlying distribution, provided that (a) each model is a good enough approximation to the underlying distribution, and (b) the models are all sufficiently different from each other. Based on that, the paper argues that a better test of typicality would be to test whether the additional data fall within the intersection of the typical sets of the ensemble of models.","This paper analyzes and extends a recently proposed goodness-of-fit test based on typicality [Nalisnick et al., ArXiv 2019].  Firstly, the authors give bounds on the type-II error of this test, showing it can be characterized as a function of KLD[q || p_true] where p is the true data generating process and q is an alternative generative process.  The paper then shifts to the main contribution: an in-depth study of a Gaussian mixture simulation along with accompanying theoretical results.  The simulation shows that maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)---due to it optimizing KLD[p_true || p_model]---does not penalize the model for placing probability in places not occupied by p_true.  This means that while samples from p_true should fall within the model‚Äôs typical set, the model typical set may be broader than p_true‚Äôs.  Table 1 makes this clear by showing that only 30-40% of samples from the model fall within the typical set of p_true.  Yet >93% of samples from p_true fall within the models‚Äô typical sets.  The paper then makes the observation that the models do not have high overlap in their typical sets, and thus p_true‚Äôs typical set could be well approximated by the intersection of the various models‚Äô typical sets.  Applying this procedure to the Gaussian mixture simulation, the authors observe that ~95% of samples drawn from the intersection of the ensemble fall within p_true‚Äôs typical set.  Moreover, ~97% of samples from p_true are in the ensemble (intersection) typical set.  The paper closes by proving that the diversity of the ensemble controls the overlap in their typical sets, and hence increasing diversity should only improve the approximation of p_true‚Äôs typical set.

","This paper addresses the question of how to stabilize a system in a vicinity of an equilibrium. While the majority of reinforcement learning algorithms rely on trial and error, which may damage the system, the authors introduce an algorithm for safe exploration and control. A traditional approach in model-based RL is to use MPC with a surrogate forward model to minimize a planning objective comprising a sum of stage costs along with a terminal cost, often chosen as an approximated value function -i.e. the optimal expected cost-to-go- which can be learned by a Bellman equation. Instead, this work is placed in the framework of Robust MPC, where this value function is replaced by a Luyapunov function $V$, which is related to the notion of stability and is only constrained to decrease along trajectories. Such a Luyapunov function, when available, provides both a safe region, defined as a level-set of V, and a MPC policy for which stability analyses have been developed: the authors extend a result from Limon et al. (2003; 2009) to show that this MPC policy enjoys asymptotic stability in general, and input-to-state stability in the presence of small enough model errors. Accordingly, the authors propose a scheme allowing to learn a Lyapunov function $V$ from demonstration data only, through a loss function that penalizes increments of $V$ along one-step transitions. A regularization parameter $\alpha$ of this MPC, which balances stability with constraints satisfaction and stage costs, is also learned jointly by an alternative training procedure. This approach is evaluated empirically on two standard constrained non-linear continuous control tasks.",0.3218390804597701,0.1037037037037037,0.15686274509803924

Pre-training has not been thoroughly explored within RL, so it is unknown how effectively task-free unlabeled datasets can be used for PT in an RL context. The authors present a simple strategy for such PT for RL that shows benefits with limited reward annotations.  ### Why is it impactful? RL is a famously expensive discipline of ML which nonetheless has huge application areas and potential in theoretial and deployment contexts. Being able to translate the improvements offerred by pre-training to the RL context would help empower this already important technique significantly.  ### Why is it hard? Why have previous approaches failed? There are several previous approaches to this problem, including some the authors readily identify in their study, such as the CQL+BC method which uses unlabeled data to perform semi-supervised offline RL by adapting policy prior data via unlabeled data.   ### How do they solve it? The authors propose using the (already published) decision transformer model, but pre-training that model first on a dataset with only action sequences, without any reward information.  ### How do they validate their solution? The authors compare their proposed framework against existing models, including both the traditional DT, a BC baseline, and the CQL and CQL+BC methods (the latter of which is a semi-supervised approach). They find slight improvements over existing methods in the extreme few-shot settings (10 observed trajectories at FT time), with further reduced gains at larger #s of observed trajectories, culminating in worse performance than traditional methods at full data scale.

434,SP:27c8b1b419259661fd5388f4a53055f90fe0b4f9,"**Summary.** This paper proposes a generalization to the typical geometric discounting scheme in reinforcement learning. In particular, a new _delayed_ discount criterion is proposed (Equation 1) that captures traditional geometric discounting when $D=0$, but also allows for other kinds of temporal preferences. Figure 2 provides a clean visual illustrating the different kinds of discounting afforded for different settings of $D$. Following this, several natural questions emerge: What happens to the $\gamma$-contraction in repeated application of the Bellman Operator? Proposition 1 addresses this question by stating that a $\gamma_D$-contraction is still guaranteed. How might typical reinforcement learning algorithms handle this new discounting scheme? The paper addresses this question by introducing two new algorithms. The first (Algorithm 1) is a generalization of Soft Actor Critic, while the second (Algorithm 2) is a policy-based algorithm that approximates the finite horizon problem. The first set of experiments focus on three maze problems. Estimates of the expected returns of learned stationary policies are reported for Algorithm 1 under four conditions as the depth $D$ is changed from 0 up to 8. The main finding is that as $D$, returns do tend to increase up to a certain point, at which point it drops (around when $D = 6$ or $7$). Further experiments inspect the performance of Algorithm 2 in a similar way (Figure 5), and contrast the performance of Algorithm 1 with typical SAC on continuous control games like Ant-v2. On the chosen four games (Figure 6), the average reward of GSAC improves over SAC slightly, though the variance is arguably slightly higher.","The paper proposes an optimality criterion for RL that is generalizes the standard exponential discount commonly used in a large volume of RL research. In particular, the paper proposes substituting the standard discount term $\gamma^t$ by a generalized discount term $\Phi_D(t)$ built from a set of discounts $\gamma_0,\ldots,\gamma_D$. The discount terms $\Phi_D$ can be defined recursively as   - $\Phi_0(t)=\gamma_0^t$ (corresponding to the standard exponential discounting); - $\Phi_D(t)=\sum_{k=0}^t\gamma_D^k\Phi_{D-1}(t-k)$  The consideration of non-uniform discounting implies that the resulting optimal policies may, in general, be non-stationary. Nevertheless, the paper introduces an equivalent to the $Q$-functions in the standard RL formulation and shows that these functions can be computed using standard dynamic programming. Letting  $Q_d^\pi(s,a)=E\left[\sum_{t=0}^\infty\Phi_d(t)r_t\mid s_0=s,a_0=a\right]$,  it follows that $Q_0^\pi$ corresponds to the standard $Q^\pi$ with discount factor $\gamma_0$, and each $Q_d^\pi$ can be computed from $Q_{d-1}^\pi$ using a dynamic programming operator $T_\pi^d$ that has $Q_d^\pi$ as its unique fixed point. These functions can also be computed using existing RL algorithms as part of a generalized policy iteration cycle that---upon convergence---may yield an ""optimal stationary policy"" (convergence is not guaranteed, though).  The paper also proposes an approximate policy that breaks down the value function for the problem into two terms---one that accounts for the rewards in the first $H$ steps and the other for the remaining steps. Under mild conditions on the discounts $\gamma_0,\ldots,\gamma_D$, the latter term can be approximated by the standard optimal value function (with standard exponential discounting) for large $H$, allowing for the computation of an approximate (non-stationary) policy.",0.16730038022813687,0.13793103448275862,0.15120274914089346

The main challenge in such tasks is the scarcity of available training data, which results in generalization problems where the agent has difficulty navigating in unseen environments. Therefore, the authors propose two key ideas to tackle this issue and incorporate them in the reinforced cross-modal matching (RCM) model (Wang et al, 2019).

The class of d-dimensional axis-aligned rectangles can be viewed as a generalization of threshold functions. Previous work have shown that the problem of privately learning thresholds is equivalent (up to constants) to the problem of privately selecting the interior point of a set of totally ordered points. A naive approach to extend this result to high-dimensional rectangles is to compute the threshold in each dimension separately and then use advanced composition. Unfortunately the dependence of the samples complexity of this approach on the dimension is $d^{1.5}$ (rather than $d$). Therefore, this problem captures one of the main technical challenges of designing DP methods, namely handling high-dimensional data.   The authors introduce a carefully constructed algorithm that applies the private interior point algorithm on each dimension, but at each step prunes some points in the dataset so that they are not used in future steps. Intuitively, this approach allows them to overcome the expensive advanced composition since not too many points will be reused. [and as a consequence, the resulting method has only linear dependence on $d$]","This paper studies the problem of privately learning an axis-aligned rectangle. In private learning, the goal is to approximate an unknown target function while leaking little information about individual training samples. More formally, the learning algorithm is required to be differentially private in the sense that for any two training sets differing in a single training sample, the distributions of the output target functions on the two data sets are (eps,delta)-close in the standard differentially private notion.  Previous work on this problem includes a learning algorithm with sample complexity O(d^1.5 (log* X)^1.5) and one with O(d log X) when the rectangles comes from a d-dimensional grid X^d. Here the dependency on eps, delta and the accuracy of the learned hypothesis has been hidden from the bound, but is polynomial in eps and the accuracy and polylogarithmic in delta.  It is known from a lower bound side that the sample complexity must depend on log*X and grow linearly with d. The goal of this submission is to derive a learning algorithm with samples depending linearly on d and as o(log X). This is achieved by presenting an algorithm needing O(d (log*X)^1.5) samples, thus shaving a sqrt(d) factor (or a logX/log*X factor) from previous work.  The main idea in the algorithm is to use a subroutine for the Interior Point Problem to find a point close to the edges of the rectangle learned. Formally, the IPP asks to output a point lying between the minimum and maximum point in a one-dimensional data base with domain X. This can be done privately with O((log*X)^1.5) samples, ignoring the dependency on eps and delta. The basic idea is to pick the outermost 100n+noise points that lie inside the rectangle along each axis. From these, the n points closest to the interior of the rectangle are selected and the IPP algorithm is run on them to output a point with i'th coordinate inside the rectangle and close to the border.",0.27586206896551724,0.15954415954415954,0.20216606498194944

726,SP:4313c3bed7eaa75d90537a6d993bb6207f4adae2,"The paper is concerned with selective classification in a stylised 'realisably noisy' data model, wherein the support of the input distribution is partitioned into two chunks, the ""informative"" $\Omega_I$ and the ""uninformative"" $\Omega_U,$ such that  - The labels are completely noisy ($\mathrm{Bern}(1/2)$) if the input lies in $\Omega_U$. - The labels are completely clean if the input lies in $\Omega_I$. - The learner has access to hypothesis classes $\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{H}$ such that      - There exists an $f^* \in \mathcal{F}$ with $f^*(x) = y$ on $\Omega_I$.     - There exists a $g^* \in \mathcal{H}$ with $g^*(x) = 2\mathbf{1}\{x \in \Omega_I\} - 1.$  The paper studies the problem of learning a pair $(f,g),$ with $g$ serving as a selector, and $f$ as a predictor, such that $g \approx g^*$ and $f \approx y$ on $\{g \ge 0\}$ (and $\approx f^*$ on $\Omega_I$ if $g$ is learnt well), with the concrete goal of attaining both small selective risk ($P(f^*(x) \neq y|g(x) \ge 0)$) and both low false alarm and low missed detection for $g$ with respect to $g^*$. As is standard in selective classification, supervision of the value of $g^*$ is not given, and instead only $(x,y)$ pairs are provided.  This is approached by designing a new loss for learning a selector given a predictor $f$, denoted $W(g;f, \theta)$, that basically uses $\mathbf{1}\{f(x) = y\}$ as proxy supervision for when $g < 0$ or $g > 0$ is preferred, but weighted by a factor to account for the prevalence of uninformative versus informative data. It is first shown, using uniform convergence techniques, that if the indicator ERM problem can be solved, then given  if $f^*_{S_n}$ is taken to be a minimiser of standard empirical risk, and $g^*_{S_n}$ to be the minimiser of an empirical version of $W(g;f^*_{S_n}, \theta)$ for appropriately chosen $\theta$ (in a way which depends on the prevalence of informative data $\alpha$), then these goals can be attained in a PAC sense, with sample complexity scaling as $\tilde\{O\}( \frac{d_\{\mathrm{vc}\}(\mathcal{F}) + d_\{\mathrm{vc}\}(\mathcal{H}) }{\epsilon^2 \alpha^2})$.  The paper then switches gears, and a alternating minimisation based heuristic method for practically learning $(f,g)$ is proposed. The idea is to first learn (soft functions) $f$ and then $g$ using relaxed versions of the above losses, and then multiplicatively increase the weight of points that are selected by the $g$ in their contribution to the loss for $f$, and repeat. The remainder of the paper is devoted to empirical evaluation of this method in two situations - firstly, uniformative (randomised labels) MNIST data is given along with varying amounts of clean Fashion MNIST data; and secondly, part of the classes from the SVHN dataset have their labels randomised to represent uninformative data, while the rest remain clean. While the scheme is observed to have similar performance in how well the selector identifies the underlying $g^*$, the proposed method has remarkably better selective risk compared to baselines from the recent selective classification literature.","This paper considers supervised learning with abstention -- where the learning method can decide to make prediction in some region of the feature space, and declare the rest of the feature space unpredictable. The setting is related to but different from the classical selective prediction, and to prediction uncertainty quantification (i.e. imbuing predictions with calibrated confidence intervals). Classical selective prediction balances coverage vs. accuracy -- whereas in the setting here the authors assume that there is a ""true"" split into an informative and uninformative partition of the feature-space,  and the goal is to both recover the partition and learn a good model on the informative partition.  The paper focuses on theoretical analysis, and also has experimental results suggesting that if the data is generated according to the author's model, than a heuristic algorithm inspired by the analysis indeed outperforms other selective prediction baselines.

This is a well-understood problem from the worst case point of view, and its complexity will depend on the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the associated Hessian matrix. However, a nice recent average-case analysis by Pedrogosa and Scieur gives the following result: if the spectral density of the Hessian converges to a ""nice"" probability measure (such as the Manchenko-Pastur law), then first-order methods that are tailored to this density may converge faster. In fact, such methods can be obtained from the three-term recurrence for the orthogonal polynomials of the measure.  The present manuscript follows up on the Pedregosa/Scieur, but departs from in two specific ways. Firstly, it considers the case where the limiting spectral law is a beta distribution, and derives the corresponding iteration. Secondly, the authors analyze the performance of this iteration under ""mispecification"": that is, they allow for more general spectral measures than the beta, and only specify how these measures behave near the extremes. In spite of this, they are able to derive bounds of the same order as in the beta case.   A few other theoretical results are presented: worst-case rates for the method derived from the beta distribution; an analysis of Nesterov's method under conditions on the tail of the spectral measure, and a result on Laguerre spectral measures. These results generalize other theorems obtained in the Pedregosa/Scieur paper. The theory is complemented by a small numerical study.  ","The paper considers the problem of average convergence rate of first order methods on a given ensemble of quadratic problems. The authors propose the Generalized Chebyshev Method (GCM) and show that it is optimal when the e.s.d. is beta distribution.

This paper proposes to improve the recently proposed work on N:M sparsity by Zhou et al., ICLR 2021. The former work results in models that have N:M unstructured sparsity that can be used in newer accelerators like Ampere but are handicapped by the fact that all the layers have the same sparsity ratios. This results in the inability to optimize for FLOPs for a given # parameter count thus having a knob for tuning the tradeoffs.   This paper proposes to fix that by proposing an iterative scheme called DominoSearch to find layer-wise fine-grained schemes/rations for N:M sparsity providing much-needed flexibility. DominoSearch operates on pre-trained models with a budget constraint and overtime figures out the good-enough mixed N:M scheme along with layer-wise sparsity for all the weight tensors on the network (layers). This is achieved with weight penalty as well as explicit layer-wise penalties combined with standard group-wise sparsity used for N:M scheme. The layer-wise penalty factor helps in trading off accuracy, FLOPs and model size is based on the sparsity achieved iteratively + a prefixed scheme like ERK for measuring redundancy.   With one caveat that all the baselines (except Zhou et al ICLR 2021) are trained from scratch and sparsity is induced during that time, while this paper works on pre-trained models.

The solution is DominoSearch, an algorithm which starts with pretrained (dense) weights and determines a pruning threshold for each group of M weights based on the initial values.  Some number of iterations of fine-tuning adjust the weights gradually lower, in turn reducing each layer's chosen N.  Once some complexity target (either parameter or FLOP count) is hit, the network's layer-wise N:M are frozen, and the weights are finally fine-tuned.

","Statistics based on KNN distances are ubiquitous in machine learning. In this paper the authors propose to apply the existing LID metric to GANs.

Now, rewrite LID(x, X) = [max_over_i (log Ri) - mean_over_i (log Ri)] to uncover that the distribution of (log-)distances is summarized as a function of the max distance and the mean distance.

As a result, LID close to the baseline LID detects both sample quality issues as well as mode dropping/collapse issues. In practice, instead of computing this measure in the pixel space, one can compute it in the feature space of some feature extractor, or in some cases directly in the learned feature space of the generator.

The approach does not leak source data from data providers and target data from consumers, and instead uses an intermediary public dataset and expert models trained on subsets of this public dataset to evaluate the data in sources that are likely to benefit the target tasks. The approach is scalable (independent of the number of source datasets), does not transfer source or target datasets to a server, transfers only expert models, and evaluates these expert models only on the source datasets and target datasets in the provider and consumer servers alone to keep computation costs low. The experiment results demonstrate the efficacy of this method, and show (somewhat surprisingly) that it is able to identify relevant source datasets even when the intermediate public dataset does not contain data relevant to the target downstream tasks.","This paper presents an idea of a data recommender system called Scalable Neural Data Server (SNDS) to support transfer learning for target customers. The interesting point is that SNDS does not store any source or target dataset on the server, but only maintains the benchmark intermediary datasets, and the pools of experts that are trained on the intermediary datasets. SNDS shares the pool of experts to both data providers and consumers to compute similarities between the consumer's data and the data provider's datasets. Image rotation prediction is used to measure the expert model's performance on the source and target datasets. In this way, SNDS indirectly measures the data similarity between the sources and targets. Compared to its predecessor NDS, SNDS trains experts for an intermediary public dataset, instead of training an expert for each source. Using this method, SNDS achieves scalability as well as securing datasets from both sides. Extensive experiments are done to gauge the usefulness of data recommended by SNDS. With SNDS-recommended source, classification performance on target datasets improved significantly. To support this, the authors show that domain confusion exists between target datasets and recommended sources. The performance gain using SNDS is comparable to that of NDS, even though SNDS trains experts on the public datasets and promises cheaper computation costs.

The neural tree architecture was tested with four different aggregation functions (used during message passing) and compared against their typical architecture implementation (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, and GIN). Empirically, using the proposed neural tree architecture always yields higher accuracy. Additional experiments were done to measure the impact on the accuracy when changing the size of the training data (% of labeled nodes), and the number of iterations of message passing.

I am in favor of accepting the paper and will argue so during the reviewers' discussion.  **Summary**  The paper investigates the information-plane analysis of deep neural network training dynamics. The original claim was that neural networks go through distinct fitting and compression phases in SGD training that are well characterized by the information plane. These findings have later been disputed (particularly due to the way mutual information is estimated) which has lead to tens of papers investigating the phenomenon with mixed conclusions. The main idea of this paper is to eliminate the estimation problem by training neural networks with quantized activations, where the discrete mutual information can be computed exactly (in the limit of infinite samples). The original claims, controversy, and follow-up works are introduced and discussed in great detail. Original experiments are repeated with a very similar protocol to facilitate comparability of results. Additional experiments on MNIST are conducted, and ablations are performed. Results show the two distinct phases for some activation functions and some layers, but not for other activation functions.  **Main contributions**  1) Thorough discussion of the history of the Information-plane analysis, the main claims and previous findings and the follow-up papers it has spawned. Significance: The background and related work is well researched and well presented, which is very helpful for readers who have not followed this line of research closely. The only downside is that there is a fairly recent review (which is cited in the paper) which somewhat limits significance.  2) Quantized-activation training to avoid estimation errors when computing mutual information terms. Significance: the idea is very sensible in principle. Unfortunately, as some of the ablations show, the qualitative results can depend strongly on the quantization bit-width chosen. This is unfortunate since the main goal was to eliminate the influence of binning in naive estimation of the mutual information. Nonetheless, the results are exact and reliable for training quantized-activation neural networks - what is not clear is how to choose the quantization. 3) Reproduction of original experiments of Schwartz-Ziv & Tishby and Saxe et al.

It presents a novel method that unifies the current classification-based approaches to overcome generalization issues and outperforms the state of the art. This work also generalizes to non-image data by extending the transformation functions to include random affine transformations. A lot of important applications of anomaly detection are based on tabular data so this is significant. The ‚Äúnormal‚Äù data is divided into M subspaces where there are M different transformations, the idea is to then learn a feature space using triplet loss that learns supervised clusters with low intra-class variation and high inter-class variation. A score is computed (using the probabilities based on the learnt feature space) on the test samples to obtain their degree of anomalousness. The intuition behind this self-supervised approach is that learning to discriminate between many types of geometric transformations applied to normal images can help to learn cues useful for detecting novelties. ","This paper proposes a novel approach to classification-based anomaly detection for general data. Classification-based anomaly detection uses auxiliary tasks (transformations) to train a model to extract useful features from the data. This approach is well-known in image data, where auxiliary tasks such as classification of rotated or flipped images have been demonstrated to work effectively. The paper generalizes to the task by using the affine transformation y = Wx+b. A novel distance-based classification is also devised to learn the model in such as way that it generalizes to unseen data. This is achieved by modeling the each auxiliary task subspace by a sphere and by using the distance to the center for the calculation of the loss function. The anomaly score then becomes the product of the probabilities that the transformed samples are in their respective subspaces. The paper provides comparison to SOT methods for both Cifar10 and 4 non-image datasets. The proposed method substantially outperforms SOT on all datasets. A section is devoted to explore the benefits of this approach on adversarial attacks using PGD. It is shown that random transformations (implemented with the affine transformation and a random matrix) do increase the robustness of the models by 50%. Another section is devoted to studying the effect of contamination (anomaly data in the training set). The approach is shown to degrade more gracefully than DAGMM on KDDCUP99.

Such a decomposition results in two parts, the first one is the difference between values of one policy under two MDPs; the second part is the difference between values of two policies under the same MDP. Using this decomposition, the paper then proposed three algorithms.   The first algorithm, called RPO, is used when there are two MDPs that the agent can interact with. The agent uses data from both two MDPs to get a good policy for one of the two MDPs. Such an algorithm is expected to be useful when gathering data from one MDP is costly while it from the other MDP is much cheaper.   The second algorithm is a model learning algorithm. In this setting, the agent only interacts with one MDP and learns a model to approximate the MDP. The RTO algorithm is different from the classic model learning algorithm (regression) in that the model is learned to achieve some consistency between the predicted values from the model and from the MDP.  The third algorithm combines the first two algorithms and is a full model-based algorithm. Specifically, now the agent only interacts with one MDP and learns a model of that MDP using RTO.

The proposed approach, the Curious Sample Planner (CSP), builds on insights in task and motion planning (TAMP), which is a standard approach for tackling these kinds of tasks. TAMP constructs a plan in the space of macro-actions (e.g., move object 1 to location (x,y)), and uses a motion planner to execute each macro-action. However, TAMP typically requires being able to describe macro-action effects and preconditions with logical predicates, which can be impossible in real-world environments, due to complex dynamics and interactions. CSP overcomes this limitation by planning in the space of macro-actions in a way that is biased toward novelty.","The paper introduces Curious Sample Planner (CSP) a long-horizon motion planning method that combines task and motion planning with deep reinforcement learning in order to solve simulated robotic tasks with sparse rewards. The CSP algorithm considers two different hierarchies of actions: primitive actions, which control the rotation of several joints in a robotic arm, and macro-actions corresponding to complex behaviours  such as moving from one position to another or linking two objects together. Macro-actions are selected using the actor-critic architecture PPO and then turned into primitive actions using geometric motion planning and inverse kinematics. Specifically, RRT-Connect is used for motion planning with the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm for inverse kinematics on a perfect model of the environment to determine the specific sequence of primitive actions necessary to execute the macro-action. As CSP is interacting with the environment, it also builds a tree of states in the environment connected by the macro-actions leading to each of them.

The authors empirically show that as denoising performance degrades on unseen noise levels, the network residual for a specific input is being increasingly dominated by the network bias (as opposed to the purely linear Jacobian term). Therefore, they propose using bias-free convolutional neural networks for better generalization performance in image denoising. Their experimental results show that bias-free denoisers significantly outperform their original counter-parts on unseen noise levels across various popular architectures. Then, they perform a local analysis of the bias-free network around an input image that is now a strictly linear function of the input.

It is crucially assumed that the entries of $A^*$ are non-negative and, by exploiting this fact, the learning problem is formulated via quadratic programming (QP): the authors show that there exist quadratic functionals whose minimisers can be used to deduce the ground-truth parameters. Furthermore, the QPs are re-written as linear programs (LPs), which are simpler to optimise and have the same solution space. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach with respect to gradient descent methods.  ","This paper gives an algorithm for learning two-layer neural networks with ReLU activation (realizable case). The network also consists of skip connections to avoid the problems of identifiability. As a warm up, the authors first give a simple algorithms based on linear regression, whenever enough samples could be observed with all-positive and all-negative entries.   They start with an algorithm for recovering the layer two parameters. For this step, they use the $\ell_2$ loss and show that its minimizer is unique and matches with the ground truth parameters under certain condition. Subsequently, the authors replace the expectation in the objective with an average over the samples (based on the empirical risk minimization principle), which they could write as a convex quadratic program without making any parametric assumption. Finally, they show that the quadratic program can be equivalently written as a linear program, which lets them recover the parameters of the second layer (in fact the inverse matrix of this weight matrix).  Once layer 2 is learnt, the original problem reduces to that of learning the single layer non-linearity. They write the objective as a sum of weight estimator and a function estimator. They show that the minimizer of this loss is achieved when the estimated weight matrix is a diagonal matrix times the ground truth and the function measures the difference between the true nonlinear function and the scaled wright matrix. Again, they learn the function non-parametrically using a quadratic program, which they equivalently write as a linear program to get the scaled weight matrix. The scaling factors in the diagonal matrix can then be learnt using a linear regression.  Finally, the authors conduct extensive experimentation to validate that their algorithms performs superior to the vanilla SGD-based algorithm.

The resulting algorithm is a variation of the generative adversarial IRL approach of Ho and Ermon, that the experiments suggest may be able to better recover the expert's policy.","This paper points out that the classical IRL approach has a tendency to match those occupancy measures that favor short-term behavior. To address this issue, a reformulation is proposed based on GAIL in order to put more emphasis on matching longer-term behavior. Specifically, the main difference is to replace the standard objective (i.e., the expectation of Q function over some initial state distribution) with the expectation of Q function over both the initial and an $\eta$-weighted future state distribution, where $\eta$ is some probability distribution over the support set of nonnegative integers. Built on this formulation, this paper proposes GIRL (and the resulting algorithm MEGAN), which follows the framework of GAIL to learn a policy that matches the $\eta$-weighted variant of occupancy measure of the expert policy.

Unsupervised representation learning has obtained impressive results in supervised scenarios, and adapting these methods to RL is an important research direction. One of the main challenges in the RL setting is that of defining the distribution of data to learn from, as well as sampling from it. The learned representations are unlikely to be useful for observations that are out of the pre-training distribution, so it is desirable to perform representation learning on data that is representative of the full state space. Previous works (Hazan et al., Lee et al.) proposed strategies to train agents that induce maximally entropic state visitation distributions, but they involve density estimation whose underlying assumptions are not well suited for pixel observations. The authors propose to overcome these limitations by using a particle based entropy estimate in the learned representation space.

In particular, they extend the standard copying techniques of  (Vinyals et. al., Gulcehre et. al., etc.) which only allow for single-token copy actions. Their span-based copy mechanism allows for multiple tokens to be copied at a time during decoding via a recursive formulation that defines the output sequence distribution as a marginal over the complete set of action combinations that result in the sequence being produced. The authors also propose a span-based beam decoding algorithm that scores output sequences via a sum over the probabilities of action sequences that produce the same output. ","This paper study the problem of editing sequences, such as natural language or code source, by copying large spans of the original sequence. A simple baseline solution to this problem is to learn a sequence to sequence neural network, which generates the edited sequence conditioned on the original one. This method can be improved by adding a copying mechanism, based on pointer networks, to copy tokens from the input. However, most of such existing approaches can only copy one input token at a time, which is a limitation when most of the input should be copied, which is the case for most editing tasks. In this paper, the authors propose a mechanism that can copy entire spans of the input instead of just individual tokens. In that case, a particular sequence can often be generated by many different actions (eg. copying individual tokens, pairs of tokens, or the whole span). It is thus important to marginalize over all the actions that generated a particular sequence. This can be done efficiently, using dynamic programming, if the probability of an action depends on the generated tokens only, but not on the sequence of actions used to generate them. In the case of neural network, this means that the decoder of the model takes the tokens as input, instead of the spans. To represent spans, the authors propose to use the concatenation of the hidden states corresponding to the beginning and end of the span. Then the probability of copying a span is obtained by taking the dot product between this representation and the current hidden state of the decoder, and applying the softmax.

Starting from an established method (FineGAN) to disentangle shape, appearance, background identity as well as a set of ""nuisance"" factors such as pose in one domain, the paper proposes to add a loss term that aims at retaining appearance when moving from one domain to another. This additional loss term essentials tries to keep the low-level image statistics between two images when both of them are generated with the same appearance, but possibly different shapes. It is trained such that it is invariant to the nuisance parameters (same object under differing views has same statistics), but discriminative towards the object appearance (different objects from the same view have differing statistics). The low level features are expressed as histograms of responses of convolution filters over the masked foreground pattern. The paper provides empirical evidences in the form of example images where appearance and shape are combined from two different domains (out of cars, birds, dogs, animals) as well as proxy measurements for the quality of the transfer: (a) how much do the low-level statistics differ in terms of $\chi^2$ distance, (b) how well is shape disentangled under changing appearance by measuring the foreground overlap between samples, (c) a user preference study (which method transfers shape and appearance better?).

It achieves this through a novel differentiable rendering engine, which allows the proposed method to back-propagate gradients to the desired physical parameters. Also interesting in the paper is the use of spherical harmonics, which restrict the algorithm to plausible lighting. The method is computationally efficient and appears to work well, generating plausible scenes that fool a classifier when imaged from different viewpoints.","This work presents a method to generate adversary examples capable of fooling a neural network classifier.

The authors argue that this leads to non-realistic attacks and that a network would not benefit from training with these adversarial images when performing in the real world. Their solution and contributions are parametric norm-balls: unlike state-of-the-art methods, they perform perturbations in the image formation space, namely the geometry and the lighting, which are indeed perturbations that could happen in real life. For that, they defined a differentiable renderer by making some assumptions to simplify its expression compared to solving a light transport equation. The main simplifications are the direct illumination to gain computation efficiency and the distant illumination and diffuse material assumptions to represent lighting in terms of spherical harmonics as in Ramamoorthi et al. (2001), which require only 9 parameters to approximate lighting. This allows them to analytically derivate their loss function according to the geometry and lighting and therefore generate their adversary examples via gradient descent.

They then show that injecting these images into the training set increase the robustness of WideResNet against real attacks.

The key insight in this paper is that when considering existing SGD methods the following behavior occurs: if we think of ""easy"" and ""hard"" to classify datapoints, a NN trained with SGD will output good uncertainty estimates early on in training, but once the network focusses on tuning the parameters for the hard cases, the uncertainty estimates for the easy datapoints deteriorates. The algorithms proposed by the authors takes an existing uncertainty method (or confidence score function) and uses intermediate snapshots of SGD training to improve the final uncertainty estimates. Note that the focus in this work is on ranking uncertainties (and the authors suggest to leave calibrating uncertainties to existing methods).","The proposed methodology draws on the connection between boosting in ensemble learning and SGD for training DNNs, whereby misclassified instances are implicitly targeted in later training iterations once easier examples have been classified correctly.

Two early stopping algorithms are proposed in order to mitigate this issue. The first approach, PES, is more robust, but too computationally expensive to be applied in practice; on the other hand, AES approximates the former procedure by directly assuming that easier training examples will be learnt earlier on in the training procedure.

The resulting M-density $p_y$ is smoother (easier to sample from), and is permutation invariant. Two factorial kernels, Poisson and Gaussian MNMs, are introduced for the convolution, and can be connected to Bayes estimator, and the learning of parametric energy and score functions. Two parameterization schemes are proposed for modeling the energy and score functions of the Gaussian M-density respectively. Empirical results on FFHQ-256 dataset are very impressive. The main contribution is the usage of factorial kernels, which is a direct extension of smoothing a density in non-parametric density estimation, and is not used for generative models before.","Given $n$ independent samples $x_i$ in a space of dimension $d$ drawn from an unknown distribution $p(x)$, this paper is interested in drawing new samples independent of $x_i$ but coming from the same unknown distribution p(x).   The classical approach consists of learning $p(x)$ from $x_i$ (i.e., approximated by $\tilde{p}(x)$) and sampling new points according to the approximated version $\tilde{p}(x)$, which remains a difficult task given sometimes the highly non-convex character of $p(x)$.   For these reasons, the authors propose to noise the data $x$ using $M$ different channels whose noise levels are chosen to obtain data denoted $y$. Since the level noise of each channel is known, this allows using a Bayesian estimator $\hat x(y)$ to find the samples in the original space. The advantage of this approach is that the Bayesian estimator depends on the density $p(y)$, which allows, thanks to a chosen parameterization of $p(y)$ (which therefore leads to a parametrization of $\hat{x}(y)$), to find the optimal parameters through a least-square objective by minimizing $\|x-\hat{x}(y)\|^2$ on the training data. The Bayesian estimator thus allows generating new samples using the optimized density $p^{\star}(y)$ with the corresponding optimal parameters.

They hypothesize that by learning how to assign credit, structural invariants can be learned which the agent can exploit to assign credit effectively and thus learn more efficiently in new environments (be it in-domain or out-of-domain). They pose the credit assignment problem as learning to predict (sparse) rewards at the end of sub-trajectories, finding the extent to which past state-action pairs appear to be responsible for these rewards (by means of the reward-prediction training), and creating a dense reward function via reward shaping (such that the set of optimal policies does not change). This is appealing as no modifications are needed to the RL algorithm/architecture. To examine their hypothesis, they created a method, called SECRET, based on self-attention and supervised learning to train credit assignment capability offline: sample many trajectories (often a mixture of expert and non-expert ones) from the source distribution, train a self-attentive seq2seq model to predict the rewards in these trajectories offline. Once this model is trained, they apply this model to a relatively small set of sampled trajectories from the target distribution and obtain the attention weights. Then, they use these attention weights as a proxy for credit assignment and, thus, use them to form a reward redistribution function. In their experiments, they show that the average attention weights actually signal the state-actions at which the future reward is triggered.

The advantage of this paper is that it can handle continuous-time graph signals and the stability of this proposed architecture is studied theoretically (Section 4) with a significant result outlined in Proposition 1 of the paper where the difference between the space-time graph filters of the original graph and the perturbed graph are upper bounded by the order of error introduced.

Moreover, that saturation level appears to vary across different downstream tasks (i.e., image characteristics and class definitions), which is seen as a sign that a generic one-fits-all feature extractor cannot be found by just scaling up.","### What is the Problem / Question? There is a ongoing trend in ML right now of exploring larger and larger pre-trained (PT) models. In general, increasing the scale of these PT models has yielded better performance on downstream tasks, though this is not universally the case.

Pre-training large models is very expensive. This study has the potential to clarify when such large-scale PT is well-motivated, and when it isn't, which could yield significant benefits for future research.  ### Why is it hard? Why have previous approaches failed? Previous approaches have examined this question at a dramatically smaller scale than this study does. For example, Kornblith et al., 2019 examined on the order of 10s of models, as opposed to thousands of models as examined here, and the results found here are correspondingly more detailed than those found in the Kornblith et al. study. _Most critically, the authors here present data that strongly suggests that rather than a linear relationship between downstream and upstream task performance, we should instead expect a saturating, non-linear trend_, which suggests that continually training larger and larger models may not be as worthwhile as was traditionally assumed. The fact that this counters an established result in the literature is an important distinction, because my native assumption would've actually been consistent with the author's finding, so without the literature bias already existing, this finding would in my opinion be less impactful. However, because it is updating a held belief in the published results, it is much more important.  ### How do they solve / answer it?

In particular, they used these metrics to define a filtration-sensitive kernel two-sample test. Moreover, they showed how to use this new class of kernels in some learning tasks. ","This paper aims to construct a family of kernel mean embeddings that capture filtration information from stochastic processes. This is achieved through the use of the signature kernel, a characteristic kernel defined on pairs of paths that can be evaluated by solving a hyperbolic PDE, and by forming conditional kernel mean embeddings of the stochastic process conditioned on its own filtration up to some time in the past.  The resulting conditional kernel mean operator itself is a stochastic process, and thus this construction can be repeated to produce higher ordered conditional kernel mean embeddings of the original stochastic process. The corresponding MMD defined from the conditional kernel mean embeddings at each order can then be used to measure distances between two stochastic processes at each order.  The first major contribution shows that higher ordered MMDs are stronger discrepancy measures than lower ordered MMDs (Theorem 2 and 4). They can then be used to perform a kernel two-sample test between paths from two stochastic processes. In particular, the paper focuses on using the second order MMD and derive consistent estimators for it (Theorem 3).  The second major contribution applies these constructions for distribution regression on stochastic processes, where the input is a collection of sample paths and the output is a vector of scalars. This is done by embedding the sampled paths from the stochastic process into a kernel mean embedding through the signature kernel, then learning the mapping between this kernel mean embedding to the vector of scalar outputs. The authors pay strong attention to the application in financial markets where the functions of interest are often discontinuous with respect to the first order mean embedding, and show they can still be learned by proving that the RKHS induced in higher orders is dense in the space of functions of interest (Theorem 5).",0.5,0.09539473684210527,0.16022099447513813

As the paper notes early on, the core of the proposed method is based on two central insights. The first is that coordinate ascent is a suitable approach for policy optimization as it decomposes the large search space (the policy space) into ""a sequence of sub-problems with smaller search spaces"". The second notes that the objective is in fact stochastic: The return can be thought of as a random variable distributed according to the mixture of a possibly stochastic control policy and the possibly stochastic transition dynamics of the environment.

1817,SP:a7207936657ad9e9582caf7d1521bb2f7f19f366,"The paper deals with one manifestation of safe exploration. Starting from a given safety function that classifies states as safe or unsafe, a modification of MBPO is used to change the Q-function in such a way that unsafe states should not be visited. The method is tested on two benchmarks.","This paper studies *safe* reinforcement learning (RL), in which an RL algorithm is tasked with learning a high-value behavioral policy while simultaneously minimizing the number of safety violations. To frame the work, the paper takes on a few key perspectives. First, that predicting only a few timesteps into the future is all that is needed to prevent safety violations. Second, that safety is defined in terms of the occupancy of set of states, as determined by the \textsc{Unsafe} predicate designed by an engineer. With this predicate in hand, a natural notion of an irrecoverable state is introduced, defined as those states that always lead to an unsafe state under any policy. Third, the paper assumes that environments are deterministic for the main analysis, and captures transition model uncertainty in the form of a next-state-set prediction.  With these perspectives in hand, the work establishes two primary contributions. The first is the formation of a safe proxy MDP, $\tilde{M}$, that uses a proxy reward and transition function. The proxy reward produces $-C$ for all unsafe states, where $C$ is a well chosen constant (to be returned to shortly). The proxy transition function replaces any unsafe transition with a self-loop. Hence, in reasoning with this proxy MDP, acting in an unsafe state will produce $-C$ reward indefinitely, thereby accumulating $C / (1-\gamma)$ value. By consequence, Prop. 1 illustrates that the Q values under the proxy MDP ensure safe actions always have higher values than unsafe actions. Then, section 3.2 takes this idea and extends it to the case when a model is being learned. In particular, it is assumed that the form of transition model learned is a ""set-valued dynamics model"" that maps each $(s,a)$ pair to a non-empty set of possible next states. With this definition of model, two Lemmas are introduced (1 and 2) that illustrate two things: First, that the cutely named ""Bellmin"" operator (which takes the s' achieved by minimizing Q w.r.t. possible next states in the set) is a $\gamma$-contraction (Lemma 1). Second, that a ""calibrated"" dynamics model (defined in Definition 2 as a set-valued model that always contains the true next-state in its next-state set) will ensure that the proxy Q function upper bounds the set-valued model's Q function. These two lemmas are used to Prove Theorem 1, which states that under a calibrated dynamics model, if there is an action with value greater than $r_{\min}/(1-\gamma)$, the greedy policy (w.r.t. $\underline{Q}$) will choose a safe action.  Then, following this analysis, the paper shifts focus on developing a practical, safe, model-based based algorithm (Algorithm 1, SMBPO). Experiments are conducted in two navigation tasks, hopper, and a cheetah variant, contrasting a variety of RL algorithms (many of which I was unfamiliar with). These include: MBPO, RRL-MF (recovery RL), LR (Lagrangian relaxation), SQRL (Safety Q-functions ), RCPO (Reward constrained policy optimization), and RSPO (Risk-sensitive policy optimization).

Differing from other manifold-based flows, the proposed methods maintain tractable densities for low-dimensional latent space. The unique contribution enables fast sampling, invertibility for inference, and efficient likelihood estimation, which inherits from normalizing flows.   Existing approaches share the drawback that exact densities cannot be calculated through the dimensionality reducing step. In the paper, the authors present an approach that offers tractable density estimation and is straightforward to train by constraining this reduction to the class of conformal embeddings. ","Many datasets of interest that are modelled with normalizing flows are assumed to lie on a lower-dimensional manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. Standard normalizing flows that are restricted to learn a *bijective* transformation are not well suited for modelling such data, as the target transformation between the lower-dimensional manifold space and the ambient space (in which said manifold is embedded) is *injective*.  In theory, an *injective flow* can be defined, where we'd parametrize an injective transformation that would only be invertible *for points on the manifold*. In practice there are two problems with this, however. First is that historically there's been much less work on designing flexible *injective* transformations, hence we don't have the same arsenal of invertible layers as we do for bijective flows. Second, the change-of-variable formula for an injective transformation includes a $\det J_f^T J_f$ term, where $J_f$ is the (rectangular) Jacobian matrix of the injective transformation $f$. This determinant, even if tractable, is typically overly expensive to compute exactly.  Authors of this work make an observation that in the bijective flow literature the game has always been to design parametric transformations $f$ that are restricted to be invertible, but *also* ones that have and easy-to-compute $\det J_f$. In line with this, authors propose a class of transformations that would have an easy-to-compute $\det J_f^T J_f$, specifically *conformal embeddings*. A conformal embedding $f$ is a transformation that preserves *angles*, but more importantly has a property that $J_f^T J_f$ is a scalar multiple of the identity, the determinant of which is simply the product of diagonal terms (i.e. an exponent of said scalar).   Authors consider a few examples of conformal embeddings (translation, scaling, an orthogonal transformation, zero-padding, etc.), which could be stacked in the same way as invertible layers are in a bijective flow. In addition, authors consider *piecewise* conformal embeddings, which are conformal *almost everywhere* (i.e. for all points except for a subset of measure zero), and can increase the expressivity of the otherwise simple conformal embeddings.  By using the conformal embeddings as injective transformations authors come up with the first injective flow with a tractable and *cheap-to-compute* density on the learned manifold. This allows said density to be used as a part of the training objective, even though an additional regularization term still needs to be included in the objective to prevent degenerate solutions.

The entire model is trained by optimising the ELBO on a set of pre-specified expert demonstrations. At test time, samples are generated from the latent space and recursively decoded to generate state and action trajectories. The method is tested on three low-dimensional continuous control tasks and is able to learn structured latent spaces capturing the modes in the training data as well as generating good trajectory reconstructions.","The paper proposes an imitation learning model able to generate trajectories based on some expert trajectories. The assumption is that observed trajectories contain multi-modal (i.e. style) information that is not naturally captured by existing methods. The authors proposed a VAE based architecture that uses a prior distribution P(z) to simultaneously generate (state-action) pairs based on a LSTM decoder (actually, one LSTM for the states and one interleaved LSTM for the actions). This decoder is learned using a classical VAE auto-encoding loss, observed trajectories being encoder through a bi-LSTM. Experiments are made on three toy examples: a simple 2d Navigation case exhibiting 3 different 'styles', a 2D circle example with also 3 different styles, and a zombie attack scenario with two different styles. The results show that the model is able to capture different clusters of trajectories. ",0.1891891891891892,0.19718309859154928,0.19310344827586204

The authors find that while increased width tends to improve robust accuracy (as has also been previously observed) the gain are mostly coming from an improvement in the standard (test) accuracy of the model, while the stability of wider models is actually _decreased._ To counteract this phenomenon, they suggest increasing the regularization term corresponding to stability as the width of the model increases and indeed observe empirical performance improvements. The authors further support their hypothesis by theoretically analyzing the effect of width on robustness in an NTK setting and observing similar results.

They do adversarial training with a hyper-parameter for the strength of the robust regularization and show that making the model wider while keeping the hyper-parameter constant will increase clean accuracy but reduce the robust generalization.

They show that both through an analytical calculation and empirical results that the local Lipschitz constant increases with the width of a network.  In further experiments the authors show that wider networks need a higher weight on the robust regularization loss to get optimal robust accuracy, while previous work often optimized this weight for smaller networks and then used the same value after increasing the width. The results are verified for other datasets and architectures and finally the authors present a strategy to adaptively choose the hyper-parameter for wider models by first optimizing it on smaller models and then optimizing during training to achieve the same ratio between natural loss and robust regularization loss for the wider model that was optimal for the smaller model.

This access can be used to obtain unbiased estimates $\nabla F(w; \xi_t)$ of the true gradient $\nabla f(w)$. This oracle access can be used to implement stochastic gradient methods, which are well studied and known to have optimal sample complexity under certain regularity conditions.   On the other hand in online convex optimization, at each time step, we obtain a loss function $f_t$ from some function class $\mathcal{F}$, and we have to minimize some notion of regret. This can be modeled like SCO by defining, $f_t:= F(.; \xi_t)$, but since there was no restriction on $f_t$'s, the $\xi_t$'s here can have arbitrary dependencies over time. In particular, they could be chosen adversarially.   In between both these extremes is the setting where $\xi_t$ could have some dependency structure. One such structure called $\phi$-mixing was introduced by [Agarwal and Duchi](https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2529). Under this dependence assumption, they provide upper bounds on the convergence of SGD.

It shows that mini-batch SGD essentially attains the $1/\epsilon^2$ sample complexity of for i.i.d. sampling when there is a low level of dependence in $\xi_t$'s, and more generally improves over vanilla SGD across various levels of dependence captured by the $\phi$-mixing assumption.","This paper studies the sample complexity of a few variants of SGD in solving optimization problems over dependent data.

Generally speaking, these two tasks are unrelated: the label recovery is a supervised learning problem, where each data point has a unknonwn true label, and the goal is to infer the label for each data point; while the clustering problem is to group data together to minimize the generalized $k$-means cost (i.e., replace $\ell_2$-error with $\ell_p$-error in traditional $k$-means), which usually has nothing to do with labelings. Although the former task also induces a clustering (in which data points with the same label belongs to the same cluster), it can be a very bad solution for the later task, and vice versa. To distinguish, for a given data set, we say a clustering is a **true clustering** if it recovers the unknown labeling (up to permutations); while we say it is an **optimal $k$-means clustering** if it solves the second task, i.e., minimizes the generalized $k$-means cost function.  The paper shows that, when the *true clustering* satisfy certain regularity conditions, it can be recovered (up to ""refinement"") by (an $O(1)$ approximation to) the \emph{optimal $k$-means clustering}.

Intuitively one can think of this as breaking the *true clusters* further into multiple smaller clusters.  Per my understanding the main result can be summarized as follows. When the true clustering is itself a good clustering with respect to the generalized $K$-means cost (Theorem 1 and 2), or if the true clustering can be broken into $L>K$ smaller clusters which have small $L$-means cost (Theorem 3), then an $O(1)$-approximation for the optimal $L$-means clustering is also a good approximation for the true clustering, in the sense that it approximately induces a refinement of the true labeling.

Unlike previous work that answered in the affirmative when all variables are observed, the authors demonstrate that the answer is negative when there is latent confounding. While identifiability guarantees exist in this setting (i.e. causal orientations or equivalently partial orderings are identifiable from data), decidability does not hold, developing further insights about the performance of LINGAM. ","This paper is about statistical causal inference. More specifically, this paper is about the causal discovery that infers causal graphs. Many methods focus on investigating the identifiability of various models for causal discovery and proposing estimation methods for the identifiable models. This paper points out that the identifiability does not necessarily imply that desirably consistent estimations methods exist.   There are many types of consistency, including uniform consistency and point-wise consistency. This paper investigates which consistency can be achieved for linear non-Gaussian acyclic models with hidden common causes, confounded LiNGAM (Hoyer et al., 2008). This analysis is based on a consistency concept named statistical decidability proposed in Genin and Mayo-Wilson (2020).   Their main result is summarized in Table 1. Genin and Mayo-Wilson (2020) showed that LiNGAM with latent confounders (Shimizu et al., 2006) is (statistically) decidable with/without the faithfulness assumption. Faithfulness is a common assumption in causal discovery (Spirtes et al., 1993).

The paper has the following contributions:  (1) The authors introduce a d-dimensional diffusion approximation, eq. (7), which they conjecture to describe the asymptotic behavior of a class of momentum-accelerated multi-pass SGD algorithms, under certain assumptions for the design. The conjecture is proven rigorously for (non-momentum-accelerated) SGD and orthogonally invariant designs A in Theorem 2, using a small adaptation of the argument by Paquette et al '11.

It presents a simple environment that helps the reader build intuition and supports the paper's empirical investigation. First, the paper shows that DDPG fails on the simple environment in ~6% of cases, despite the solution being trivial‚Äîgo left from the start state. The paper then augments DDPG with epsilon-greedy-style exploration to see if the cause of these failures is simply inadequate exploration. Surprisingly, in 1% of cases DDPG still fails. The paper shows that even in these failure cases there were still rewarded transitions that could have been learned from, and investigates relationships between properties of individual runs and the likelihood of failure. The paper then explains how these failures occur: the policy drifts to always going right, and the critic converges to a piecewise constant function whose gradient goes to zero and prevents further updates to the policy. The paper then generalizes this deadlock mechanism to other continuous-action actor-critic algorithms like TD3 and discusses how function approximation helps mitigate this issue. Finally, the paper gives a brief overview of some existing potential solutions.","Overview: This paper describes a shortfall with the DDPG algorithm on a continuous state action space with sparse rewards. To first prove the existence of this shortfall, the authors demonstrate its theoretical possibility by reviewing the behavior of DDPG actor critic equations and the ‚Äútwo-regimes‚Äù proofs in the appendices. They then demonstrate the occurrence of the critic being updated faster than the actor, leading to a sub-optimal convergence from which the model can never recover. In this demonstration, they use a very simple environment they created, ‚Äú1D-Toy‚Äù. The 1D-Toy environment is a one-dimensional, discrete-time, continuous state and action problem. Moving to the left at all in 1D-Toy results in a reward and episode end. Episode length was set at 50, as the agent could move to the right forever and never stop the episode. The authors demonstrate how the failure of the agent to obtain 100% success in this simple environment was, in fact, due to the phenomenon mentioned earlier. If the agent managed to obtain a reward very early on in training, it was highly likely the agent would converge on an optimal solution. If not, the actor would drift to a state were it no longer updates, and the critic would similarly no longer update either, resulting in a deadlock and suboptimal policy. The authors then generalize their findings using a helpful figure (Figure 7) which describes the cyclical nature of the phenomenon and how it can happen in any environment. Finally, the authors mention potential solutions to prevent the training failure from occurring, such as avoiding sparse rewards, replacing the critic update to avoid loss, etc.",0.22279792746113988,0.15579710144927536,0.1833688699360341

In particular, the considered gradient noise consists of a finite-variance part (corresponds to the multiplicative noise in SGD for least square) and an infinite-variance part (corresponds to the additive noise in SGD for least square). The main results can be viewed as a law of large number and a central limit theorem in the absence of finite-variance. First the authors show that when the loss is ""strongly convex"" and ""smooth"" in the $p$-PD sense and the heavy-tail part noise has finite $p$-moment, SGD (with decaying stepsize) iterates converges to the correct optimum, and the convergence rate is justified in the p-norm sense. Moreover, if the heavy-tail noise is the domain of normal attraction of some stable distribution, then the properly normalized SGD iterates also converges to the stable distribution. Finally, the heavy-tailed noise model is justified from two linear model examples.","The authors analyze SGD for a class of strongly-convex functions and under (possibly) infinite noise variance, i.e., the pth moment of the noise exists for $p \in [1,2)$, but noise variance is not assumed to be bounded. Such noise behavior is defined as heavy-tailed. Additionally, the noise is assumed to be state-dependent such that the noise vector has a component whose variance is bounded by a function of the query point (iterates). For standard analysis of SGD, noise vectors are assumed to be independent of query points and of each other. Specifically, for a class of strongly convex functions (denoted as p-positive definite (p-PD), p=2 being positive definite Hessian) and under heavy-tailed noise, the authors:  -	Quantify the convergence rate with respect to (w.r.t.) distance to unique optimum in $L^p$, which approaches the optimal rate in strongly convex setting as $p \rightarrow 2$. This result is achieved for SGD without any modifications and under state-dependent noise model. -	Prove that normalized Polyak-Ruppert average (uniform average) converges weakly to an $\alpha$-stable distribution, under additional assumptions on the noise and the Hessian. Central Limit Theorem (CLT) does not hold under heavy-tailed noise model.  In order to reinforce the setting they consider and verifiability of their assumptions in practice, authors discuss about the real-world examples that admit heavy-tailed noise and satisfy p-PD assumption.

Results on the public datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Fashion MNIST, and Cat-vs-Dog show that the proposed method has better anomaly detection (measured with AUC) than the state of the art.  The paper also displays qualitative anomaly detection results and an ablation study that shows: a) how close to uniform distribution (on hypersphere) the feature representations are as a function of batch size, and b) how AUC is affected with batch size and depth of MLP project heads.","This paper proposes a framework for deep one-class classification (an example application being anomaly detection).  The basic idea is to combine self-supervised representation learning (eg through a proxy task such as rotation prediction or contrastive learning), with a classical approach to one-class classification, such as one-class SVM or KDE.  This is in contrast to existing methods for deep one-class classification that use simulated outliers to form a surrogate classification loss and then train end-to-end.  The paper further improves on the first stage of representation learning, by introducing modifications to contrastive learning to make it more appropriate for one-class classification.  The main insight is to introduce distribution augmentation, where geometric transformations of images, such as rotation, are treated as separate instances, to be separated from the original view.  This is motivated from the perspective of reducing uniformity of the inliers across the unit hypersphere, to allow for better separation from outliers.",0.1837837837837838,0.21518987341772153,0.19825072886297374

The skills are learned by maximizing the mutual information between the next state s‚Äô and the current skill z conditioned on the current state s. Maximizing this objective corresponds to maximizing the diversity of transitions produced in the environment, while making the skill z be informative about the next state s‚Äô. The idea is that using this objective leads to learning a diverse set of skills that are predictive of the environment. The skills z correspond to a set of action sequences, which are represented by a distribution \pi(a|s,z). Because the above objective is intractable to compute (because it relies on the true dynamics p(s‚Äô|s,a)), it is variationally lower bounded using the approximate dynamics q_{\phi}(s‚Äô|s,z), which represents the transition dynamics when using a certain skill and this variational lower bound is optimized to produce the optimal q_{\phi}(s‚Äô|s,z) and \pi(a|s,z).","This paper proposes a novel approach to learn a continuous set of skills (where a skill is associated with a latent vector and the skill policy network takes that vector as an extra input) by pure unsupervised exploration using as intrinsic reward a proxy for the mutual information  between next states and the skill (given the previous state).

The paper proposes three criteria which leads to three types of loss to train the setter model, i.e., goal validity (the goal should be achievable by some existing policy), goal feasibility (how probable the current policy can achieve the goal), and goal coverage (the sampled goals by the setter need to cover all possible goals). A judge model is needed to output the feasibility of a given goal. So the autocurricula scheme contains the solver (agent), the setter, and the judge, each having its own combination of loss and they are trained together.

In experiments, they evaluate the proposed method on three types of tasks in two environments, i.e., 3D color finding and grid world alchemy. The goals in the two environments are similar in that they all aim to achieve some color or color pairs. The difference lies in that the first one finds colors while the second pick up colors. Each environment can be changed between episodes by changing the colors of objects in the scenes. Experimental results show that different combinations of the three types of losses can bring improvements in some scenarios.

The downside of TEE is that it is expensive and slow to run. This paper proposes outsourcing the linear evaluation portions of the DNN to an untrusted stack that's co-located with the TEE. To achieve privacy (i.e., the input isn't revealed to the untrusted evaluator), the approach adds a random number r to the input vector x, evaluates f(x+r) on the untrusted stack, then subtracts off f(r) from the output.

Input-SAD is a simple baseline that tries to get structure-attribute disentanglements by individually processing graph structures and node attributes. For structure, the original node attibutes are replaced by out-degrees only, and passed to GNNs, while for attibutes, the node attibutes are passed to fully-connected networks. Embed-SAD is a more elaborate method to disentangle the GNN embeddings by posing two types of additional losses, i.e., the edge-reconstruction loss for structures, and the Noise-Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss to maximize the mutual information against the structure-encoding vectors, in addition to the original loss for supervision. The paper also develops an interesting evaluation metric called SAD-Metric where node attibutes or graph structures are exclusively perturbed for each graph, and prediction for whether that perturbation is for structure or for attibutes made by the element-wise absolute differences between embedded vectors before and after the perturbation. This SAD-Metric can quantify the extent to which the obtained representation can detect which perturbation, that for structures or that for attibutes, is made for each sample graph. The experimental results also demonstrated that the structure-attibute disentanglement by Embed-SAD learning strategy actually improved the prediction performance of many off-the-shelf GNNs over many different graph- or node-level tasks.","This paper focuses on disentangling embeddings of the structure and the attribute of graph. The authors' key idea is that the structure and attribute information should be split in GNN.

Bilevel optimization consists in two nested optimization problems: the upper-level aims at minimizing an objective function where some of the variables are a solution of the lower-level problem. In the stochastic setting, upper and lower-level objectives are not accessible and are instead replaced by unbiased estimators. In addition to several smoothness assumptions, this work and several recent others consider the case when the lower-level problem is strongly-convex, which guarantees that the lower-level solution is unique, the existence of the upper-level gradient, and allows to provide convergence guarantees to stationary points even when the lower-level solution is not computed exactly.   This work studies two algorithms (MRBO and VRBO) which both achieve a sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-1.5})$, which improves upon the previous optimal complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-2})$. Both algorithms exploit variance reduction  to achieve the desired complexity. MRBO is single loop and combines variance reduction and momentum while VRBO is double loop and uses large-batch gradients to reduce the variance.

As in this paper, we can interpret some distance measure between the original input and its ""counterfactual explanation"" point as a kind of cost of achieving a different decision, usually for/to an individual who gets a negative decision to understand what they would need to change to receive a positive decision. In a fairness context we can consider differences in such costs between different groups as evidence of unfairness, for example if there are higher costs (on average, say) for individuals from a protected non-discrimination group.

Although such removal (of words) can be beneficial for Natural Language model debugging, it adds an additional bias in Computer Vision. This is because removing regions implies replacing the corresponding pixels with some baseline values e.g., black color, random intensities, average pixel values etc. The paper shows that irrespective of which part of the region is being masked (i.e., removing original image pixel values and replacing with baseline values), masking small portions of image can lead to CNNs predicting incorrectly and unreliably. The authors show that the CNN based classifiers seem to rely on the ‚Äúmasking pattern‚Äù to make the prediction, rather than the remaining (unmasked) portions of the image. In fact, even after removing some image regions randomly, the output distribution gets highly skewed towards a few classes e.g., crossword, jigsaw puzzle etc. Using LIME as a case study, it shows that missingness bias can lead to inconsistent and indistinguishable explanations. Moreover, this bias can be overcome if the model is trained with suitable augmentations that remove regions while training. The paper illustrates how using Visual Image Transformers is a better natural choice as these models allow actual removal of image regions rather than replacement with baseline values. Hence, these issues seen in CNNs due to missingness bias is not prevalent in ViTs.","The authors focus on the problem of model debugging (for image recognition).

Then, they demonstrate that the proposed method can simply 'skip' those patches that are masked and it does not result in a skewed result.

Given all current information I remain in favor of accepting the paper (my score and confidence remains unchanged).  **Summary:**  The paper investigates the lottery-ticket effect in detail in reinforcement learning tasks. While it has been shown before that lottery-tickets also exist in deep reinforcement learning, this paper performs a thorough analysis using (i) both discrete and continuous action- and observation-spaces, (ii) an on- and an off-policy RL algorithm (as well as a behavioral cloning baseline), and (iii) careful ablations to distinguish the importance of the binary mask and the initial weight values which together form a winning ticket. Various controls and ablations are performed, leading to a plethora of experimental results. The main result is that winning tickets can be found efficiently via iterative magnitude-based pruning in RL tasks, and that in many tasks the binary mask contributes more to performance than the initial weight values. Compared to the supervised (behavioral cloning) baseline, RL performance degrades more rapidly with increasing sparsity levels which is attributed to the distributional shift introduced by exploration in RL. Finally, the paper also investigates the effect of pruning (in winning tickets) of the first-layer weights, and shows that in many cases multiple input dimensions (or regions, which are often semantically meaningful) can be pruned without loss in task performance. This observation could be an interesting approach to producing sparse input representations in RL.  **Main contributions**  1) Investigation of the lottery ticket effect in RL. Significance: though it has been reported before that winning tickets can be found in RL, the paper performs an impressive amount of empirical investigations, including many baselines and ablations across a range of continuous and discrete tasks and an on- and off-policy RL algorithm as well as a supervised baseline. Naturally, results vary somewhat between settings and variations, but the sheer number of results allows to extract trends that hold across many variations. This significantly increases the reliability of the findings. 2) Disentangling the lottery ticket effect through control experiments that allow to attribute the effect strength to (i) the binary mask, (ii) the initial weight-values, or (iii) the layer-specific pruning ratios, which are all combined in a winning ticket. Significance: these control experiments shed some important light on the role of the three components. Interestingly, the binary mask seems to play the most important role in RL tasks, whereas initial weight-values seem to matter more in the supervised setting. This is an interesting, and very consistent insight which might spawn further investigation into the topological structure induced by the winning mask.  3) Investigation of first-layer weights of winning tickets. In many cases whole input dimensions (in continuous tasks) or input regions (in discrete tasks) that are irrelevant to the problem are pruned. This reflects an important (implicit?) regularizing effect - the corresponding weights remain at low magnitudes and can be safely pruned. Investigation of the pruning patterns or pruned dimensions also provides semantic insight which allows for interesting hypotheses regarding how the network solves the task and which information it ignores. Significance: this is an interesting artifact of the analysis of winning tickets in RL. Results are promising and ask for further investigation and perhaps even formulation of a method for sparse/compressed input representations for RL (the identified irrelevant dimensions also transfer to non-pruned architectures). ","This paper investigates the Lottery Ticket hypothesis in the context of deep RL for identification of sparse task representation in low-dimensional control tasks. This is primarily an empirical investigation where several experiments and consequent analysis reveal what a ""winning ticket"" means in case of policy models or Q function approximators given that Deep RL is prone to gradual distribution shift. The experiments also help to identify how standard magnitude pruning will behave under different environment updates, feedback schedules or initialization dynamics.

Then the authors proposed a physics-based color augmentation, called Planckian jitter to improve the performance. The proposed Planckian jitter performs better with the recent contrastive and self-supervised learning schemes.","**Overview.** This paper proposes a novel type of image colour augmentation to be used during self-supervised learning (SSL).  **Background.** In a typical SSL setting, similar samples are generated by randomly augmenting an image in a variety of different ways: random cropping, colour jittering, random rotations, etc. These similar images are then passed through a neural network, and the predicted features for similar samples are trained to be close to each other based on some similarity metric (ignoring the contrastive term description here as it is not directly related to the paper).  **Motivation.** In this paper, the authors address the issue of using colour jittering as augmentation during SSL. Specifically, using colour jittering pushes the network towards invariance to image colours, while relying more on the shape and texture of objects when making predictions. The authors point out that despite the benefits of this for many general detection tasks, this will be a detrimental property when dealing with more colour-dependant tasks.  **Method.** Thus, they propose to use Planckian jittering instead of colour jittering. Planckian jittering is a physics based augmentation method proposed by the authors (although the formulations for it come from existing literature) to re-illuminate the training images within a realistic distribution which leads to more realistic and constrained colour augmentations than colour jittering. The paper claims that Planckian jittering still helps improve network's dependence on shape and texture of objects (although less than colour jittering), while limiting the network's invariance to image colours.  **Experiments.**  6 SSL models were trained independently on CIFAR-100: 3 used different variants of the Planckian jittering, 2 used different variants of colour jittering (w/ and w/o Random GrayScale), and 1 used no augmentations. Linear classifiers for CIFAR-100 and FLOWERS-102 classification tasks were then trained on top of each of the SSL models' features, where FLOWERS-102 is the task that is claimed to be more heavily colour-dependant. Moreover, an extra linear classifier was trained on the concatenation of features from a Planckian jittering and a colour jittering model (called the ""Latent space combination"" model). Based on accuracy, ""Latent space combination"" outperforms all other models by a significant margin on both datasets. Planckian jitter seems to outperform other augmentations on FLOWERS-120 (Table 1), which supports the claim of the authors. On CIFAR-100, Planckian jitter performs slightly worse than colour jittering, which the authors attribute to the reduction of colour invariance in the features.  A very similar experiment was also done with different datasets (SSL training on tiny-imagenet, linear classifier trained on FLOWERS-102, CUB200, VEGFRU, T1K+), which also obtained similar results and conclusions. Moreover, in another similar experiment, the SSL models were trained with different SSL configurations (SimSiam, SimCLR, Barlow Twins) to indicate the generality of Planckian jitter for different types of SSL configurations. In another experiment, the robustness of the different models on augmented images using Planckian jittering was evaluated. Lastly, the colour sensitivity was analyzed to inspect the impact of colour information in neuron activations for each model.",0.5,0.045364891518737675,0.08318264014466546

The authors show that the learning dynamics  converges to the multi-agent performatively stable point for small learning rates.

2818,SP:fe24152df3ec630eed6ec8adbf88d3a044e78123,"This paper considers reinforcement learning, a common model which has seen success recently in many areas (e.g. games, robotics, autonomous vehicles).  Prototypical reinforcement learning algorithms explore the action space in order to maximize their rewards as much as possible, potentially ignoring impacts of the chosen actions or safety constraints.  Typical to many real-world scenarios, though, are constraints on the selected actions allowing the algorithm designer or practitioner to enforce certain constraints on the selected actions in the environment (e.g. ensure that the autonomous vehicle stays within the dictated lines on the road, etc).  This is typically done by introducing a cost-function and adding an additional constraint that the resulting policies have long-run discounted cost upper bounded by a given constant.  While many RL algorithms have been designed in this setting, they mostly focus on either taking lagrangian relaxations of the given policy constraints, or constructing convex approximations to the non-convex objectives to optimize (which also in turns adds to additional complexity in constructing higher order moments of the objective for optimization).  In contrast, the authors in this paper take a different view, via the following: 1. Construct tight upper and lower bounds on the difference in value functions for arbitrary policies with respect to arbitrary functions $\phi$, a given additional discount parameter $\lambda$ 2. Instantiate the upper bound with $\phi$ taken as the value function to get a lower bound on the difference in value between any two policies 3. Instantiate the lower bound with $\phi$ taken as the cost-value function to get an upper bound on the cost-difference between any two policies  Once these bounds are established, the algorithmic approach is simple.  In the first step they perform a performance improvement step to improve the performance of the policy by maximizing the lower bound on the difference in value between the two policies.  The second step is a projection step, where after lagrangianizing the constraint set they minimize the lower bound on the difference in costs between the two policies.  The authors show a guarantee on per-step improvements on the rewards and cost for this proposed approach assuming exact maximization / minimization of these objectives.  To be more specific, the authors consider the typical RL model with an MDP characterized via $(S, A, P, r, \gamma)$.  They consider the goal of maximizing the expected long term rewards $r$.  However, there is an additional cost function $c$ and they add an additional constraint that the long-run discounted cost is upper bounded by a given constant $b$.  The hope is that the learned policy picks actions which satisfy the long-run average cost constraint while simultaneously maximizing the expected rewards.  The authors first start-off by proposing a novel bound, generalizing the policy performance difference $J(\pi_\theta) - J(\pi_{\theta'})$ between any two policies.  In particular the difference is upper and lower bounded by two terms.  The first term can be interpreted as the expectation between the TD errors of $\pi_\theta$ and $\pi_{\theta'}$ where TD errors are computed for an arbitrary function $\phi$.  The second part is the discounted distribution difference between the two different policies.  These bounds are then instantiated with different functions $\phi$ and parameters in order to get lower and upper bounds on the performance difference between the policies with respect to the costs and rewards of the problem.  Once these lower and upper bounds on the performance difference are established, the algorithm falls naturally by maximizing the reward lower bound and minimizing the cost upper bound.  This is then theoretically justified by providing a per-step improvement with respect to the two different objectives.    To complement the algorithmic framework, the authors present a set of synthetic experiments to compare the efficiency and constraint violation of the resulting policies of their method and others in the literature.  In particular, they test the policies on three different environments and compare to several other existing algorithms in the literature (more on this later).  They show that their algorithm and approach dominates others in terms of performance while simultaneously ensuring the cost constraints.","The paper studies the problem of learning under constrained Markov decision processes.
